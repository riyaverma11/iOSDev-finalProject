# Project 7 - *Task App*

Submitted by: **Riya Verma**

**Task App** is an app that lets users add tasks with the following details: title, description, and due date. Users have the ability to edit, delete, and update their tasks. When updating a task, it highlights in a different color which makes it obvious that it's complete. The app also has a calendar view where users can see their tasks organized by date! The tasks are always saved, so users don't have to worry about losing their tasks!
