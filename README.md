## Overview

### Description

An app that has lot of general information about the Eras Tour. Since Taylor's one of the biggest artists in the world, going on the biggest tour, it only makes sense to have an app that allows users to keep up with details! The app could have features like: Eras Tour trivia, outfit inspirations, lyrics of all the songs on the setlist: basically anything that enhances your Eras Tour experience, before or after the concert!

### App Evaluation

- **Category:**
    -  Entertainment
- **Mobile:**
    - Eras Tour popularity can be attributed to social media and the mentality of "you have to be here!". As such, it's natural to follow the hype and create aa mobile app that will surely fall in the hands (haha) of those who are already on their phone tracking everything about Taylor.
- **Story:**
    - The Eras Tour is a once-in-a-lifetime event of revisiting Taylor Swift's 16 year long career. There is so much history surrounding the setlist, the traditions, and even the outfits. Those interested in the cultural phenomenon can dive into the lore.
- **Market:**
    - Anyone interested in learning more about the Eras Tour: those attending the concert and those who aren't. Anything related to Taylor Swift gains immense popularity (if done right).
- **Habit:**
    - Each time a concert happens, the app updates with new information (surprise songs, announcements, guests, etc.) prompting users to check out what happened. The app has features like trivia and outfit inspiration, creating usage before and after concerts.
- **Scope:**
    - V1 would allow users to see Taylor's tumblr feed, where she posts her personal updates (about tour and music). V2 would incorporate an outfit inspiration for each of the Eras. V3 would add a trivia section with questions about Eras Tour history/statistics. V4 would incorporate a countdown section that tells users how many months, days, etc. away their tour date is.
