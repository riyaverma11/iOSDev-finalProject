iOS Final Project - App Brainstorming
===


## New App Ideas - List
1. Eras Tour / Taylor Swift Info App
   - An app that has lot of general information about either the Eras Tour or Taylor Swift. Since she's the one of the biggest artists in the world, going on the biggest tour, it only makes sense to have an app that allows users to keep up with details about both!
2. Brain Game App
    - Multiple games that aim to work the user's brain. There are lots of games out there, but not many are enriching. This app would be a one-stop shop to work on improving your critical-thinking while having fun!
3. College New Student App
    - An app that would have multiple resources that would be beneficial to an incoming college student. It would have college packing list, important TODOs, FAQ section. It would be a great way to get as much information about the intro to college from one app!
4. Goal Tracker App
    - An app that would help users keep track of their goals and how often they complete them. Users have the option of creating goals and setting how often they should be accomplished (daily, weekly, monthly). Once completed, users can earn points!
5. Recipe App
    - An app that would have lots of recipes that a user can explore. Users would have the ability to filter recipes by ingredients, cook time, allergies, etc. Users can then save favorite recipes!

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
### 1. Eras Tour Info App
   - **Description**: An app that has lot of general information about  the Eras Tour. Since Taylor's one of the biggest artists in the world, going on the biggest tour, it only makes sense to have an app that allows users to keep up with details! The app could have features like: Eras Tour trivia, outfit inspirations, lyrics of all the songs on the setlist: basically anything that enhances your Eras Tour experience, before or after the concert!
   - **Category:** Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Eras Tour popularity can be attributed to social media and the mentality of "you have to be here!". As such, it's natural to follow the hype and create aa mobile app that will surely fall in the hands (haha) of those who are already on their phone tracking everything about Taylor.
   - **Story:** The Eras Tour is a once-in-a-lifetime event of revisiting Taylor Swift's 16 year long career. There is so much history surrounding the setlist, the traditions, and even the outfits. Those interested in the cultural phenomenon can dive into the lore.
   - **Market:** Anyone interested in learning more about the Eras Tour: those attending the concert and those who aren't. Anything related to Taylor Swift gains immense popularity (if done right). 
   - **Habit:** Each time a concert happens, the app updates with new information (surprise songs, announcements, guests, etc.) prompting users to check out what happened. The app has features like trivia and outfit inspiration, creating usage before and after concerts.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to see Taylor's tumblr feed, where she posts her personal updates (about tour and music). V2 would incorporate an outfit inspiration for each of the Eras. V3 would add a trivia section with questions about Eras Tour history/statistics. V4 would incorporate a countdown section that tells users how many months, days, etc. away their tour date is.

### 2. Brain Game App
   - **Description**: Multiple games that aim to work the user's brain. There are lots of games out there, but not many are enriching. This app would be a one-stop shop to work on improving your critical-thinking while having fun!
   - **Category:** Education Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** The best way to pass time is using your phone; most social media users are using the app vs the website. Convenience is incredibly valuable to users. 
   - **Story:** A majority of times when someone is bored or wants to procrastinate/be busy, they reach for their phones to keep their brain occupied. When using the Brain Gains app, users satisfy their need to be on their phone while having an enriching experience (as opposed to brain rotting on social media). 
   - **Market:** Anyone who enjoys brain teasers/puzzles or anywho is interested in improving their critical thinking through games!
   - **Habit:** People are constantly on their phones, especially when they become enchanted by a game. They want to prove to themselves that they can beat the level and unlock harder versions of the game.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to access multiple brain games. V2 would incorporate saving statistics from the games. This could be used to incentivize improvements. V3 would add the ability for users to earn points as they complete more games and at more challenging levels. V4 would a shop where users can spend their points.
